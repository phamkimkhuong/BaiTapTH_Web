                The Sunny Acres Farmshop aims to offer the highest quality fresh
                produce. You can pick your own or buy it in our shop. Set amidst
                acres of outstanding natural beauty on the beautiful rolling
                hills northeast of Council Bluffs, the Farm Shop is easily
                reached on Highway G, with easy access from Interstate 80.
              </p>

                Farms can be educational and Sunny Acres is no exception.
                Schools and home-schooling parents, take an afternoon with us at
                our Petting Barn. We have over 100 friendly farm animals in a
                clean environment. Kids can bottle feed the baby goats, lambs,
                and calves while they learn about nature and the farming life.
                Please call ahead for large school groups.
              </p>

                When the sun goes down this time of year, we're all looking for
                a good fright. Sunny Acres provides that too with another year
                of the Haunted Maze. Please plan on joining us during weekends
                in October or on Halloween for our big Halloween Festival.
